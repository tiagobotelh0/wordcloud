# Word Cloud

This repo contains our attempts at generating word clouds using the ```Python``` and ```Julia``` programming languages.

[The documentation](http://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/) for the ```Python wordcloud``` package is an excellent source for beginners.

See [WordCloud.jl](https://juliahub.com/docs/WordCloud/hBjWI/0.2.2/) for an even simpler ```Julia``` package. (**Warning: part of the documentation is in Mandarin**).
