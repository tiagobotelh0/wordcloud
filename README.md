# Word Cloud

This repo contains our attempts at generating word clouds using the ```Python``` and ```Julia``` programming languages.

[The documentation](http://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/) for the ```Python wordcloud``` package is an excellent source for beginners.

See [Veja.jl](https://johnmyleswhite.github.io/Vega.jl/wordcloud.html) for an even simpler ```Julia``` package.
